## ReleaseToolHS2

  Read the translations repository folder and make a file clean to release. The release file will have:
  
  1) Cleaned all empty and commented lines in RedirectedResources (if it exist). If a file only has empty or commented lines it will be ignored.
  
  2) Folders RedirectedResources, Text and Texture will be zipped (if they exist).
  
  3) readme, license and config folder.
  
  **IMPORTANT:** The file `config\ AutoTranslatorConfig.ini` must have the Language key configured correctly.

## Translate Duplicates

  See if an untranslated line has been translated before and write that translation. If there are several translations for the same sentence, only the first one is used. Useful for RedirectedResources folder. Use with caution!
